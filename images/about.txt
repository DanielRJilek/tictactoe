The Libro de los juegos (Spanish: "Book of games"), or Libro de axedrez, dados e tablas ("Book of chess, dice and tables", in Old Spanish), is a 13th century Spanish treatise of chess that synthesizes the information from Arabic works on this same topic, dice and tables (backgammon forebears) games,[1] commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and Le√≥n and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283.[2][3] It contains the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games, and is an exemplary piece of the literary legacy of the Toledo School of Translators.

The Libro de los juegos is one of the most important documents for researching the history of board games. This "celebrated MS book of games" has been described as "one of the choicest treasures of the library of the Escorial"[4] as well as "perhaps the greatest source of information on board games ever compiled during the Middle Ages."[5] It is both "the earliest treatise on chess and the oldest document relating to tables which have had their origin in Europe."

The book consists of ninety-seven leaves of parchment, many with color illustrations,[3] and contains 150 miniatures.[2] The text is a treatise that addresses the playing of three game types: a game of skill, or chess; games of chance, or dice; and a third game type, tables, which combines elements of both skill and chance. These games are discussed in the final section of the book at both an astronomical and astrological level. Examining further, the text can also be read as an allegorical initiation tale and as a metaphysical guide for leading a balanced, prudent, and virtuous life.[6] In addition to the didactic, although not overly moralistic, aspect of the text,[7] the manuscript's illustrations reveal a rich cultural, social, and religious complexity.

Alfonso was likely influenced by his contact with scholars in the Arab world.[3] Unlike many contemporary texts on the topic, he does not engage the games in the text with moralistic arguments; instead, he portrays them in an astrological context.[3] He conceives of gaming as a dichotomy between the intellect and chance. The book is divided into three parts reflecting this: the first on chess (a game purely of abstract strategy), the second on dice (with outcomes controlled strictly by chance), and the last on tables (combining elements of both).[3] The first section of the book also speaks of some other games of abstract strategy, notably alquerque and nine men's morris, among others. The text may have been influenced by Frederick II's text on falconry.
